# Zooscan
This repository is used by the Llopiz Lab at WHOI to collaborate on projects related to the ZooScan plankton imaging system. 
Here, we share code to read in PID (Plankton ID) files and analyze these files using R. 
* See the "Documentation" file for calculations and other important information.
* See the "Functions" folder for the functions used to help automate data processing and analysis. 
* See the "PID Files" folder for the raw data files.
